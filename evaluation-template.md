### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

***Great job including user stories and documenting problems that you encountered while working through the project!***


* __Technical Requirements__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

***Great job working through challenges and improving your code during Project Week. The interface and CSS is awesome! Your game is really creative and I think you have an eye for design as well :) .***

* __Code Quality__:  **Does Not Meet Expectations**

***I am giving a "Does Not Meet Expectations" because your code isn't quite there yet. I am still confused about certain functions and syntax you are using for some variables, as well as missing some of the main functionality for comparing cards. Your definitely progressing, and I really liked how you refactored on Wednesday and used an array of objects!***  

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: **Meets Expectations**

***Great job working through problems and being persistent! I saw a lot of progress in the last week and you will get there, so keep asking questions and continue to seek help if your confused on anything.***

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
